This project was to demonstrate use of Google Firebase and moment.js.

##Tech Used
Technologies used were Google Firebase, Moment.js, Javascript, jQuery, HTML, CSS

##Features
Has a user input to add trains and their info, when the submit button is clicked the vaalues of the fields are uploaded to firebase and then that information is displayed in the table to the right.
The page is for the most part mobile responsive, with the exception that the table overflow when the screen is phone-sized is smaller than the data it is meant to contain. Based on the user-input for first train time, the next arrival and minutes until that arrival are calculated using moment.js.
